## Overview


This lab documents a cybersecurity audit for a mock organization, focusing on compliance with NIST SP 800-53 Media Protection controls. It highlights the audit methodology, findings, and risk assessment outcomes, emphasizing the importance of regulatory compliance and organizational assurance.

## Audit Process

### 1. Plan
- Develop an audit plan with clear objectives, timelines, and methodology.
- Conduct initial meetings to identify systems, processes, and personnel in scope.
- Gather initial documentation, such as Information Security Policies (ISP), configuration standards, vendor documentation, and previous audit reports.

### 2. Determine Audit Scope
- Define the people, processes, and technology included in the audit.
- Identify in-scope requirements and controls.
- Engage with departments to identify third-party service providers (TPSPs), clients, system/application owners, and system inventories.
- Ensure alignment of scope with business objectives and regulatory requirements.

### 3. Collect Evidence
- Gather relevant documentation from departments:
  - Network Team: Diagrams, configurations, internal policies.
  - Accounting Team: Audit reports, third-party contracts, vendor agreements.
  - Security Team: Encryption policies, breach reports, security policies.
- Conduct interviews with key personnel (e.g., system owners, administrators, legal, HR).

### 4. Review Documentation for Compliance
- Compare the organization's ISP against industry standards.
- Highlight gaps and recommend remediation actions.
- Identify areas requiring further investigation during the audit execution.

### 5. Validation Testing/System Review
- Verify evidence reliability and compliance through:
  - Hands-on system testing.
  - Vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and configuration checks.

### 6. Post-Audit Procedures
- **Reporting Findings**:
  - Document findings in a standardized format.
  - Highlight non-compliance areas and recommend remediation.
- **Remediation Plan**:
  - Develop timelines for addressing non-compliance.
  - Track and verify changes after implementation.
- **Follow-Up Audit**:
  - Schedule additional audits to verify remediation.
- **Continuous Improvement**:
  - Update audit processes based on lessons learned and regulatory changes.

## Audit Findings

### Key Observations
1. **Control Weaknesses**:
   - Missing policies for media sanitization and transport.
   - Insufficient evidence for specific controls.
2. **Strengths**:
   - Comprehensive documentation for media protection.
   - Effective access restrictions and marking controls.

### Risk Assessment Results
- **High-Risk Areas**:
  - **Media Sanitization**: Inadequate disposal procedures.
  - **Media Transport**: Insufficient tracking mechanisms.
- **Moderate Risk Areas**:
  - **Media Access**: Limited monitoring of sensitive media.
- **Low-Risk Areas**:
  - **Media Storage**: Policies ensure secure environments.

## Risk Assessment Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Policies, procedures, and interview inputs.
2. **Likelihood and Impact Mapping**: Assign values based on threat probability and consequences.
3. **Risk Calculation**: Map likelihood and impact to predefined risk levels.

## Reporting

### Executive Summary
- **Purpose**: Ensure compliance with NIST SP 800-53 Media Protection controls.
- **Scope**: IT and administrative departments.
- **Results**: Identified high-risk areas and recommended remediation.

### Recommendations
1. Establish comprehensive media sanitization procedures.
2. Improve tracking mechanisms for media transport.
3. Enhance monitoring and access controls for sensitive media.

### Conclusion

The Cybersecurity Audit Lab demonstrates a structured approach to auditing media protection controls in alignment with NIST 800-53 standards. By simulating a real-world audit scenario, this lab highlights the importance of compliance, risk identification, and mitigation strategies to ensure sensitive data remains secure throughout its lifecycle.

Key takeaways include:

- A step-by-step walkthrough of audit processes, from planning to reporting.
- Practical application of NIST 800-53 Media Protection controls.
- Hands-on examples of evidence collection, risk analysis, and compliance evaluation.
