## Overview


This lab demonstrates the process of conducting a comprehensive cybersecurity audit for a mock organization, focusing on compliance with NIST SP 800-53 Media Protection controls. It provides a detailed walkthrough of the audit lifecycle, including planning, evidence collection, and evaluation of findings.

Following the audit, the lab transitions into a structured risk assessment phase, where identified issues are analyzed for their likelihood and impact. This process highlights the importance of prioritizing vulnerabilities, mitigating risks, and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.

The lab emphasizes the integration of auditing and risk assessment to enhance an organization's security posture, regulatory adherence, and overall risk management strategy.

## Audit Process

### 1. Plan
- Develop an audit plan with clear objectives, timelines, and methodology.
- Conduct initial meetings to identify systems, processes, and personnel in scope.
- Gather initial documentation, such as Information Security Policies (ISP), configuration standards, vendor documentation, and previous audit reports.

### 2. Determine Audit Scope
- Define the people, processes, and technology included in the audit.
- Identify in-scope requirements and controls.
- Engage with departments to identify third-party service providers (TPSPs), clients, system/application owners, and system inventories.
- Ensure alignment of scope with business objectives and regulatory requirements.

### 3. Collect Evidence
- Gather relevant documentation from departments:
  - Network Team: Diagrams, configurations, internal policies.
  - Accounting Team: Audit reports, third-party contracts, vendor agreements.
  - Security Team: Encryption policies, breach reports, security policies.
- Conduct interviews with key personnel (e.g., system owners, administrators, legal, HR).

### 4. Review Documentation for Compliance
- Compare the organization's ISP against industry standards.
- Highlight gaps and recommend remediation actions.
- Identify areas requiring further investigation during the audit execution.

### 5. Validation Testing/System Review
- Verify evidence reliability and compliance through:
  - Hands-on system testing.
  - Vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and configuration checks.

### 6. Post-Audit Procedures
- **Reporting Findings**:
  - Document findings in a standardized format.
  - Highlight non-compliance areas and recommend remediation.
- **Remediation Plan**:
  - Develop timelines for addressing non-compliance.
  - Track and verify changes after implementation.
- **Follow-Up Audit**:
  - Schedule additional audits to verify remediation.
- **Continuous Improvement**:
  - Update audit processes based on lessons learned and regulatory changes.

## Audit Findings

### Key Observations
1. **Control Weaknesses**:
   - Missing policies for media sanitization and transport.
   - Insufficient evidence for specific controls.
2. **Strengths**:
   - Comprehensive documentation for media protection.
   - Effective access restrictions and marking controls.

## Reporting

### Executive Summary
- **Purpose**: Ensure compliance with NIST SP 800-53 Media Protection controls.
- **Scope**: IT and administrative departments.
- **Results**: Identified high-risk areas and recommended remediation.

### Recommendations
1. Establish comprehensive media sanitization procedures.
2. Improve tracking mechanisms for media transport.
3. Enhance monitoring and access controls for sensitive media.



## Risk Assessment Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Policies, procedures, and interview inputs.
2. **Likelihood and Impact Mapping**: Assign values based on threat probability and consequences.
3. **Risk Calculation**: Map likelihood and impact to predefined risk levels.
### Risk Assessment Results
- **High-Risk Areas**:
  - **Media Sanitization**: Inadequate disposal procedures.
  - **Media Transport**: Insufficient tracking mechanisms.
- **Moderate Risk Areas**:
  - **Media Access**: Limited monitoring of sensitive media.
- **Low-Risk Areas**:
  - **Media Storage**: Policies ensure secure environments.



### Conclusion

The Cybersecurity Audit and Risk Assessment Lab highlights the critical interplay between auditing and risk assessment in maintaining regulatory compliance and strengthening an organization's security posture.

By conducting a thorough audit aligned with NIST SP 800-53 Media Protection controls, this lab showcases the importance of identifying vulnerabilities and gaps in compliance. Transitioning seamlessly into risk assessment, it emphasizes evaluating issues based on likelihood and impact to prioritize mitigation efforts effectively.

This integrated approach underscores the value of combining detailed audits with risk-focused analysis to drive informed decision-making and proactive cybersecurity strategies.
